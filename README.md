I am trying to do a bert2bert translator.

But something wrong. I put test on github to get help from the community. severall files here. 
- Bert_translator is my first version
- bert2bert_quicktest is a short code focused on the first identified errors
- bert2bert_oktest is a short code where everithing works ok, it is adapted from the discussion I had with an expert, here https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/bert2bert-translator/167108
- Bert_translator_v2 is the correction of the first version,.... but something is still strange when I train /eval the model at each epoch+ the scheduler seems to create errors.
